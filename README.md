========
This is just a very basic thing.

I wanted to :
- automate a tedious workflow (fill a timesheet for a company, and having to make a copy of this timesheet to send to another company)
- try to make a chrome extension
- start something on GitHub

So, basically, this just takes data from a webpage, write it in the extension popup, and use a mailto link to send it by email.

Potential updates :
- use Google Mail API to send mail directly
